**Let's be good at coding interviews by solving algorithmic problems!**

Most of these problems came to me from my Students who were interviewed in various companies in Belarus, Germany and USA. Some of them - I personally asked potential candidates during the interview. And some, I faced when I was interviewed :).

These problems can be solved in 15-20 minutes on a whiteboard. I highly recommend do it themselves without internet and spying, and only after codding, check your solution and find the best one.
